# PGM_Project
Code for PGM project (Shounak Sural, Sulagna Sarkar and Brandon Abranovic) - Fall 2022

Link for CARLA and real world dataset- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2V5VqGPotEPETTzmzDU68r0AxyWJhTk?usp=sharing
Place the datasets (trainA and trainB) in the datasets folder within each of the model folders for vanilla CycleGAN, CycleGAN with better cycles and Bayesian CycleGAN. Now, follow the steps within each of the README files placed in these folders. For CycleGAN with better cycles, follow the instructions from the READMe in the following link-https://github.com/SsnL/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. For DeblurGAN, create a directory with outputs from the above models. Now, add a path to this directory in the testing command specified in its README file. To test with Detectron 2, open the Carla_Detectron2.ipynb file and replace the path in the code below "We first download an image from the COCO dataset:" with your image path.
